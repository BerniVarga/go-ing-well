This repo is intended to capture some of my learning spaces and experiences. Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/BerniVarga/learning-material/wiki) for more.


For now, read more about the language that made me excited about coding:
* [Go](https://github.com/BerniVarga/learning-material/wiki/Go-Links)

Some of my reasons for falling in love with GO:
* was simple enough to:
   - get started with little experience
   - write "simple" (readable and short) code without hiding much of the complexity
   - to use less abstraction (always felt like we're overused abstractions before)
   - feel the bravery to explore it (the go source code and standard library are "limited" in size, and accessible)
   - explore language mechanics (memory allocations specifically) 
   - understand why my applications are failing (no more frameworks on frameworks, making it very hard for me to understanding what is actually going on)
* was fast enough to:
   - write it with Java background
   - run and deploy it (vs long waiting times I got used to working with Java and monoliths before) - ok, microservices and then k8s played a good part in this point
* was interesting enough to:
   - make me rethink my previous errors handling
   - explore and not be afraid of concurrency
   - explore more on garbage collection
   - rethink dependency management
   - make me curious and ask more whys
* was just approachable enough due to:
   - being it open source and not huge in code size
   - having a friendly community behind, always eager to help
   - having so cute gopher designs :P
