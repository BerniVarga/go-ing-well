# GO learning material

Hi Everyone. 

I've been coding in Golang for over 8 years now, and after so long sometimes coding can become automatic.
However, during this time I also had the possibility to introduce new people to the language, and I found that a set of resources guiding their early journey proved to be appreciated. 

I also find these materials useful when I am about to fill in some gaps in my knowledge - gaps that I often realise while trying to explain Go to others. It is also interesting how to find ways for catching up with all the new stuff that has been introduced to the language during the years.

With all these in mind, here's a set of links that might help you orienteer.

### Basic Go.
* [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) - quick tour that introduces you to the basic usage of the language
* [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/) - web service that runs your go code; fun way to quickly try out your code

### Documentation.
* How to write code: https://go.dev/doc/code - short intro
* [Effective GO](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) - a personal favourite with lots of best practice tips
* [Code review comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) - code review ideas, will make you think about ways of coding; i find it as a good tool why developing my personal choice or opinion on how to go about writing code

### Packages.
* https://pkg.go.dev/std - standard library packages (check the source code too)
* https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools - go tools
* https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-init - go modules
* https://github.com/golang/go - source code
* https://go.dev/ref/spec - language specification

A lesson I learnt while writing Go is how easy it is to check the source code when you're unsure about something. 
I also like to look into how people write code in the standard library, and take that as an example to follow. Sometimes I find different/"inconsistent" approaches of doing things even there - which is also an interesting insight to have, and gives me more freedom to think and play around.

Depending on your background, you might be more or less comfortable with doing so, but my advice is to give it a go. 
You might enjoy it and learn something new.

I'm planning on extending this docs and adding more resources here, but in the meantime, if you'd need guidance around some topics - let me know.
